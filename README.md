This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.


## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from all levels of experience. This guide is intended to help you make a successful contribution to our project.

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository.** This will create your own copy of the project that you can work on.
2. **Clone your fork to your local machine.**
3. **Create a new branch for your contribution.** This will keep your changes separate from the main codebase.
4. **Make your changes.** Be sure to follow the project's coding style and conventions.
5. **Test your changes.** Run the project locally and make sure that everything works as expected.
6. **Commit your changes.** Add a descriptive commit message that explains what you changed.
7. **Push your branch to your fork.**
8. **Create a pull request (PR).** This will submit your changes for review by the project maintainers.

### Pull Request Guidelines

* **Include a clear and concise title and description.** The title should summarize the main change in your PR, and the description should provide more detail.
* **One PR per feature or bug fix.** Avoid combining multiple unrelated changes into a single PR.
* **Test your changes thoroughly.** Make sure that your changes do not break any existing functionality.
* **Write clear and concise commit messages.** Each commit message should explain what you changed and why.
* **Be responsive to feedback from the maintainers.** If they ask you to make changes, be sure to do so promptly.
